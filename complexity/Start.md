# On Complexity

This series of articles aims to give you:

- **An understanding of where complexity comes from in software development**.  How we start of with simple building blocks, but end up in a mess.

- **How complexity affects the Information Systems we build.** Although software gets increasingly mature and featured, we suffer from the Paradox Of Choice and end up in an integration nightmare

- **Some predictions about how we will deal with complexity in the future.**


## Background Reading

This trail assumes familiarity with the [Risk-First Risks](../risks/Risk-Landscape.md), especially [Complexity Risk](../risks/Complexity-Risk.md).
