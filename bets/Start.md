# On Bets

> "Every gambler knows / that the secret to survivin' / is knowin' what to throw away / and knowin' what to keep." - [_The Gambler_, Kenny Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambler_(song))

This is a short sequence of articles that looks at the idea of _betting_, at different levels within software development:  first from a task-planning perspective, then coding and then debugging.  

## Outcomes

- Talk about _bets_ rather than _tasks_.
- Understand risk as a _spectrum_, rather than an item on a register.
- Understand the appropriate domain for Agile and Planned methodologies.
- Move beyond "Agile"  and "Planned" approaches, to a right-tool-for-the-job approach.
