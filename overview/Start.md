# Risk-First: An Overview

The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  But what unites them all?

The Risk-First perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different _software development risks_.  Risk isn't something that just appears in a report, it actually drives everything we do.  

## Tracks

There is quite a lot of material on this site so to aid digestion, Risk-First is split into several main _tracks_ (shown on the menu at the top of this page).  Here's what we have so far:

1. **The Overview (This Bit)**:  Who this site is for, some summary materials and an explanation of Risk-First diagrams.
 
2. **[Thinking Risk-First](../thinking/Start.md)**: Thinking about Software Development from a new perspective - it's not about code and issues and bugs and releases, but all of those things represent ways in which we deal with risks.
  
3. **[The Risk Catalog](../risks/Start.md)**:  Here, we try and break down the different risks that you face on a software project, and talk at a high level about the kind of actions you take to deal with them.
 
4. **[On Bets](../bets/Start.md)**: If software development is all about risk, then doesn't that make us all gamblers?  Here, we look at the types of bets we make every day when building software, and look at how we might try to maximise our profits.


5. **[On Estimating](../estimating/Start.md)**: _Estimating_ is the _bÃªte noire_ of software development: simple to conceptualise, but a mine-field for the unwary. Here we take it apart from a Risk-First perspective to try and understand why it is so difficult and what we should do about it.
 
6. **[On Complexity](../complexity/Start.md)**:  _(Under Construction)_ The complexity of the work we do is a big source of risk.  Can we understand it better?
 
## Outcomes 
 
This article track aims to give you a taster of what Risk-First is about, who it is for and hopefully pique your interest to read further.
