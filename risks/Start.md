# A Risk Catalog

Much of the content of [Risk-First](https://riskfirst.org) is a collection of [Risks as Patterns](../overview/A-Pattern-Language.md).  

Here, we're going to take you through the various types of Risk you will face on every software project.  

## Outcomes

After reading this section of [Risk-First](https://riskfirst.org), hopefully you will:

 - Appreciate the **different kinds of risk** you face on software projects, and how to identify them.
 - Learn a **Pattern Language**: that is, a vocabulary of terms which you can use for discussing these risks with colleagues.
 - Know the main **actions you can take** to handle each type of risk.
