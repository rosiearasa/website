# Next: Scrum?

I'm not sure exactly how people are finding Risk-First on the internet.  Seems like I get a lot of traffic referred from Github.   For some reason, even fairly specific searches don't make much of an impact in Google.  

But nevertheless, I'm still seeing a fair bit of traffic over the last couple of weeks, and despite the content being free, people are buying the book.  

It's got me thinking about what I want to do next on this project.  A quick recap:

- [Thinking Risk-First](/thinking/Start.md) was explaining how Software Development is really an exercise in risk management.  Although that sounds a bit dull (maybe complex even), I try to explain it really simply.  

- [The Risk Catalog](/risks/Start.md) looks at the types of risks we face in Software Development.  I spend a while breaking down the different types.

So next, we should look at the different _techniques/practices/actions_ we use, and explain the qualities of them.  Generally, all activity boils down into something like this:

Finally, we need a track on software _methodologies_ (e.g. DevOps, XP, etc) as collections of techniques.  (Some people don't like this use of the word "methodology".  I can see why, but, it's the most commonly used term for this type of thing).

Put together it looks like:

I think I'm probably going to start tackling these two parts (3&4) simultaneously.  I'm going to write an article on Scrum first, looking at some of the key practices it espouses such as:

- Timeboxing
- Backlogs / Backlog Grooming
- Daily Standup
- Burndown Chart
- Estimates - Point/Relative
- Planning Poker

There are overlaps with other things... XP or Lean for example, but I think I've got to start somewhere.  

In the future, I'd like to cover DevOps, Prince2, SAFe and so on.  I think I may have people who can help me with a couple of these, as I'm not expert on everything.

Let me know what you think - especially if you have any good war stories or points to make on the areas above.
