# New Proof

A new proof of Risk-First Volume 1 arrived via Amazon today.  I think it looks pretty good (photos attached).

If anyone's interested, I'm using Pandoc to generate Latex from the github markdown articles, and I have a custom Latex template based on Memoir.  This all gets rendered into PDF, which I can upload into Kindle Direct Publishing in order to produce a proof.

Hopefully this'll be the last draft before it comes out on 21st Feb.   I'll post again as that happens.

cheers,
Rob
